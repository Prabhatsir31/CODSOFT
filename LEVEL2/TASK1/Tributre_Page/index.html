                <p> Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was one of the most distinguished spiritual leaders of India who took the ancient Indian message
                    of Vedanta to the West and at the same time called upon Indians to serve God in man. He was not a prophet aloof from the miseries
                    of the world. As a patriot-saint, he exhorted Indians to serve India by especially working for the economically backward sections of
                    society. Thus, he has left behind a dual legacy of spiritual awakening and national revival.</p>

                <h2><u>Birth and Early life</u></h2>
                <p>Swami Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Dutta in Calcutta on anuary 12, 1863. His parents were Bhuvaneshwari Devi and Vishwanath
                Dutta, an attorney-at-law at the Calcutta High Court. In 1881, as a young student at Scottish Church College, Calcutta,
                he first met the great saint and mystic, Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886). Young Naren was seeking God, and whichever holy man he met,
                Naren asked if he had seen God. The answer in most cases was in the negative. But, when he asked Sri Ramakrishna the same question, the
                latter affirmed that he had seen God, just as clearly as he saw him, or probably even better. He added that there were means to realise God
                and if Naren followed them, he too would do the same. It was the authenticity in this promise of direct experience of God that appealed to the
                intensely rational Narendranath, and he was equally moved to see the all-encompassing love of the saint. Eventually, Narendranath accepted
                Sri Ramakrishna as his spiritual master. After the passing away o f Sri Ramakrishna, Narendranath organised some of his brother
                disciples and together they all took the vow of sannyasa (renunciation and monkhood) in December 1886. They lived in a temporary
                monastic premise at Baranagore in Calcutta. Between 1888 and 1889, he lived there. He also travelled to various pilgrimage centres in
                North India.</p>

                <h2><u>Return To INDIA</u></h2>
                <p>From London, the Swami, accompanied by his Western friends and disciples, travelled to Italy by train. After visiting different cities
                    in Italy, he sailed back for India from Naples on December 30, 1896 and reached Colombo on January 15, 1897. In Colombo, a great
                    reception was awaiting him. He delivered some famous lectures in Colombo and at the request of the local people, accepted to undertake
                    a tour in different cities of Ceylon, giving lectures and attending reception programmes. From Ceylon, he reached Pamban on January
                    26. After visiting a few places in Tamil Nadu, where once again great reception awaited him, he finally reached Madras, where he
                    was welcomed by the people with immense reverence and enthusiasm. He stayed on in Madras for some time to deliver some of his
                    most important lectures in India. From there he proceeded back to Calcutta, where too, a grand reception awaited him. He
                    then lectured in Calcutta.</p>

    <!--His Work in India  -->
            <div class="work">
                <h2><u>His Work in INDIA</u></h2>
                <P> Vivekananda’s idea was that a true exchange should take place between India and the Western world—where the latter
                    would learn from Indian spirituality, while India would benefit from the West’s material advancement. He also showed Hindus the
                    basis of their unity—the principles taught by Vedanta. His contribution to Indian society and the world at large was that he set up an organisation
                    like the Ramakrishna Mission, which till this day, maintains an impeccable reputation in work related to the spiritual and social welfare
                    of the nation. Swamiji has similarly inspired the setting up of several other organisations, like the Vivekananda Kendra, which has
                    developed with his ideas of a spiritually inspired nationalism as the nucleus. Since his times till now, his fiery words have inspired
                    many to take up the cause o f serving the nation. He emphasised on the need to educate the women and the poor o f India. A visionary,
                    he also realised the importance of scientific and material advancement for the welfare of India. Hence, when Jamsedji Tata had offered
                    to fund a monastic organisation for him, he instead asked the great entrepreneur-cumphilanthropist to fund the setting up of an
                    institute for scientific research and training. His proposal later materialised into the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru.

                Practical patriotism means not a mere sentiment or even emotion of love of the motherland but a passion to serve our fellow-countrymen.
                I have gone all over India on foot and have seen with my own eyes the ignorance, misery and squalor of our people. My whole soul is a fire and
                I am burning with a fierce desire to change such evil conditions. If you want to find God, serve man. To reach Narayana you must serve the
                Daridra Narayanas - the starving millions of India.
